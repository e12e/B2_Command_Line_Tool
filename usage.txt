    b2 list_buckets

        Lists all of the buckets in the current account.

    b2 list_file_names <bucketName> [<startingName>] [<numberToShow>]

        Lists the names of the files in a bucket, starting at the
        given point.

    b2 list_file_versions <bucketName> [<startingName>] [<startingFileId>] [<numberToShow>]

        Lists the names of the files in a bucket, starting at the
        given point.

    b2 ls [--long] [--versions] <bucketName> [<folderName>]

        Using the file naming convention that "/" separates folder
        names from their contents, returns a list of the files
        and folders in a given folder.  If no folder name is given,
        lists all files at the top level.

        The --long option produces very wide multi-column output
        showing the upload date/time, file size, file id, whether it
        is an uploaded file or the hiding of a file, and the file
        name.  Folders don't really exist in B2, so folders are
        shown with "-" in each of the fields other than the name.

        The --version option shows all of versions of each file, not
        just the most recent.

    b2 make_url <fileId>

        it is public.

        of the bucket updated.

    b2 upload_file [--contentType <contentType>] [--info <key>=<value>]* <bucketName> <localFilePath> <b2FileName>

        Uploads one file to the given bucket.  Uploads the contents
        of the local file, and assigns the given name to the B2 file.

        Content type is optional.  If not set, it will be set based on the
        file extension.

        Each fileInfo is of the form "a=b".

    b2 version

        Echos the version number of this program.
